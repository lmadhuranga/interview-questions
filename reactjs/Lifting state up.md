"Lifting state up" is a term used in React to describe the process of moving the state from a child component to its parent component. It involves restructuring the component hierarchy and passing the state data and related functions as props from the parent to the child components.

The main motivation behind lifting state up is to share and manage state data that needs to be accessed or modified by multiple components. By lifting the state up to a common parent component, you can ensure that the data remains synchronized and consistent across the child components.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept of lifting state up:

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Parent Component</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <ChildComponent count={count} incrementCount={incrementCount} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

```jsx
// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ count, incrementCount }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Child Component</h3>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment Count</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent;
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` maintains the state variable `count` using the `useState` hook. It also defines the `incrementCount` function to update the `count` state.

The `ParentComponent` renders the `ChildComponent` and passes the `count` state and the `incrementCount` function as props. The `ChildComponent` can access and display the `count` value, and when the button is clicked, it calls the `incrementCount` function to update the state in the `ParentComponent`.

By lifting the state up to the `ParentComponent`, both the parent and child components have access to the `count` state and can modify it. This ensures that the state remains synchronized, and any changes in the child component will be reflected in the parent component as well.

Lifting state up promotes the principle of single source of truth and makes it easier to manage and synchronize state across components, especially when multiple components need to interact with and modify the same state data.
