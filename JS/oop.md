OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, data structures that contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. OOP is based on the concept of "objects," which represent real-world entities, and it aims to model the interactions and behaviors of these entities in a software application.

Key principles of Object-Oriented Programming include:

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., an object. It allows data to be accessed and modified only through the defined methods, providing data hiding and protection.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex objects by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only relevant information. It allows developers to create a clear and simple interface for interacting with objects.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). It enables code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors based on their context. It allows a single interface to represent different data types or objects.

Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming:

1. Modularity: OOP promotes modularity, making it easier to maintain, update, and extend the codebase by breaking it into smaller, reusable components (objects).

2. Code Reusability: Inheritance and polymorphism enable code reuse, reducing duplication and promoting more efficient development.

3. Encapsulation and Data Security: Encapsulated objects protect data from unauthorized access and modification, ensuring data security.

4. Easy Maintenance: OOP's modular structure and abstraction make code maintenance and bug fixing more manageable.

Example of a simple OOP concept in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Car {
  private make: string;
  private model: string;

  constructor(make: string, model: string) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  getMake(): string {
    return this.make;
  }

  getModel(): string {
    return this.model;
  }

  startEngine(): string {
    return `${this.make} ${this.model} engine started.`;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
console.log(myCar.getMake()); // Output: Toyota
console.log(myCar.getModel()); // Output: Camry
console.log(myCar.startEngine()); // Output: Toyota Camry engine started.
```

In this example, we create a `Car` class with properties `make` and `model`, and methods `getMake`, `getModel`, and `startEngine`. The properties are encapsulated within the class, and the methods provide an interface to access and interact with the car object.

In the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), "abstract" and "implementation" refer to different concepts related to classes and methods.

1. Abstract Class:

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods. Abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes, providing a common interface and defining some basic functionality that subclasses must implement. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated because they are not fully defined; they may have some unimplemented methods that need to be overridden in the subclasses.

Key points about abstract classes:

- Abstract classes are defined using the `abstract` keyword.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and regular methods with implementation.
- Subclasses (concrete classes) that inherit from an abstract class must provide implementations for all the abstract methods, or they also become abstract.
- Abstract classes are used to enforce a common structure among related classes while allowing flexibility in the specific implementations.

Example of an abstract class in TypeScript:

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract area(): number; // Abstract method without implementation

  getColor(): string {
    return 'Unknown'; // Regular method with implementation
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  area(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.area()); // Output: 78.53981633974483
console.log(circle.getColor()); // Output: Unknown
```

2. Implementation:

Implementation refers to the process of providing a concrete definition or realization for methods declared in an abstract class or interface. In other words, it involves writing the actual code for the methods that were left abstract in the parent class.

In the example above, the `Circle` class implements the `area()` method from the `Shape` abstract class. The implementation of the `area()` method in the `Circle` class calculates the area of a circle using the provided radius.

In summary, abstract classes provide a structure and common interface for related classes, while implementation involves providing concrete definitions for abstract methods in the derived classes. Together, they form an essential part of the inheritance and polymorphism features in object-oriented programming.
