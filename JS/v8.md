In V8 (the JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome and Node.js), the event loop follows a specific order of execution for tasks in the queue. The order of execution is as follows:

1. **Synchronous Tasks:**
   Synchronous tasks are executed first in the order they appear in the script. These are regular JavaScript statements and function calls that do not involve any asynchronous operations.

2. **Microtasks Queue:**
   After executing all synchronous tasks, V8 checks the microtasks queue. Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks (asynchronous tasks) and are executed before the event loop proceeds to the next macrotask. Microtasks usually include callbacks from resolved promises (`then`, `catch`, `finally`) and certain DOM APIs like `MutationObserver`.

3. **Macrotasks Queue (Callback Queue):**
   After processing the microtasks queue, V8 checks the macrotasks queue (also known as the callback queue). Macrotasks include asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, I/O operations, and other browser/DOM APIs.

4. **Rendering and Rendering Callbacks:**
   After completing the macrotasks queue, V8 performs rendering updates if there are any pending changes to the UI. After rendering, any rendering callbacks (if any) may be executed.

5. **Idle Callback Queue:**
   After all the above steps are completed, V8 checks the idle callback queue. Idle callbacks are used to schedule non-essential tasks that can be performed when the main thread is idle.

In summary, synchronous tasks will run first, followed by microtasks, then macrotasks, and finally, rendering updates and idle callbacks if applicable. This sequence ensures that synchronous code is executed before any asynchronous tasks, and microtasks (higher priority) are processed before macrotasks (lower priority).
