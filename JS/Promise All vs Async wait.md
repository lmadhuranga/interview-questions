Apologies for the confusion. If you want to use Promises directly instead of the Fetch API, you can create and handle Promises for your API calls. Here's an example:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // API call 1
    // Simulating an asynchronous API call with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data1 = { message: 'Data 1' };
      resolve(data1);
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
  });

  const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // API call 2
    // Simulating an asynchronous API call with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data2 = { message: 'Data 2' };
      resolve(data2);
    }, 1500); // Simulating a delay of 1.5 seconds
  });

  Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
    .then((values) => {
      console.log(values);
      // Process the data or perform additional operations
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
}

fetchData();
```

In this example, we create two Promises (`promise1` and `promise2`) to simulate asynchronous API calls. Each Promise is constructed with the `new Promise()` syntax and contains the logic for the respective API call.

Inside each Promise, we use `setTimeout` to simulate a delay before resolving the Promise with the desired data. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this `setTimeout` with your actual API call.

The `Promise.all()` method is used to wait for both Promises to resolve. It takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a new Promise that resolves with an array of the resolved values from the input Promises.

Finally, we use `.then()` to handle the resolved values (data) from the Promises. Inside the `.then()` callback, you can process the data or perform additional operations. If any error occurs during the Promise chain, the `.catch()` block will catch the error and log it to the console.

This example demonstrates how you can create and handle Promises for multiple API calls and use `Promise.all()` to wait for all the Promises to resolve before processing the data.

In modern JavaScript, you can use async/await syntax along with `fetch` to write cleaner and more concise code for handling API calls. Here's an example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response1 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');
    const data1 = await response1.json();
    console.log('Data 1:', data1);

    const response2 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');
    const data2 = await response2.json();
    console.log('Data 2:', data2);

    // Process the data or perform additional operations

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

In this example, we define an `async` function called `fetchData()` to handle the asynchronous API calls. 

Inside the function, we use the `await` keyword to wait for the `fetch()` function to resolve with the response. We can directly call `.json()` on the response to parse the JSON data.

By using `async/await`, the code appears more synchronous and easier to read. The flow of execution is straightforward, with the `await` keyword indicating points where the code should pause and wait for the Promise to resolve.

If any error occurs during the API calls, it will be caught in the `catch` block, and the error will be logged to the console.

Using modern JavaScript features like `async/await` provides a more expressive and intuitive way to handle asynchronous operations and improves the readability of your code.


When using `Promise.all`, if any of the promises in the array get rejected (i.e., an error occurs), the whole `Promise.all` operation will reject immediately. This behavior is by design to ensure that you are aware of any failed requests or operations.

However, if you want to handle the errors of individual promises while allowing the other promises to continue processing, you can use `Promise.allSettled`. The `Promise.allSettled` method returns a promise that resolves with an array of results after all the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected. Unlike `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled` does not short-circuit on the first rejection, and all the promises are allowed to complete.

Here's an example of how to use `Promise.allSettled`:

```javascript
const promises = [
  fetch('url1').then(response => response.json()).catch(error => ({ error: true, message: error.message })),
  fetch('url2').then(response => response.json()).catch(error => ({ error: true, message: error.message })),
  fetch('url3').then(response => response.json()).catch(error => ({ error: true, message: error.message })),
  // Add more promises as needed
];

Promise.allSettled(promises)
  .then(results => {
    // `results` is an array of objects representing the settlement of each promise
    results.forEach(result => {
      if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
        console.log('Fulfilled:', result.value);
      } else {
        console.error('Rejected:', result.reason);
      }
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error occurred during Promise.allSettled:', error);
  });
```

By using `Promise.allSettled`, you can process the results of each individual promise regardless of whether they succeeded or failed. This way, you can continue handling the other requests even if some of them fail.
