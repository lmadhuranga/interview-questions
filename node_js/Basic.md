### 1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google, which also powers the Chrome browser. Node.js provides a rich set of APIs and libraries that enable developers to build scalable and efficient network applications.

Here are some key features and use cases of Node.js:

1. *Server-Side Applications*: Node.js is commonly used for building server-side applications. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it well-suited for handling concurrent connections and real-time applications.
2. *Web Applications*: Node.js can be used to build web applications and RESTful APIs. It has a robust ecosystem of frameworks and libraries such as Express.js, Nest.js, and Koa.js, which simplify web application development.
3. *Microservices*: Node.js is a popular choice for building microservices architectures due to its lightweight and scalable nature. It allows you to create individual services that communicate with each other using APIs.
4. *Real-Time Applications*: Node.js is particularly suitable for building real-time applications such as chat applications, collaborative tools, and online gaming platforms. It facilitates bidirectional communication between the server and clients through WebSockets or other real-time protocols.
5. *Command-Line Tools*: Node.js can be used to develop command-line tools and scripts. Its ability to access the file system and execute shell commands makes it useful for automating tasks, building build tools, and running scripts.
6. *Internet of Things (IoT)*: Node.js can be used for developing applications for IoT devices. Its lightweight runtime and event-driven architecture make it well-suited for handling IoT communication protocols and interacting with sensors and actuators.
7. *DevOps Tools*: Node.js is used in various DevOps tools and frameworks for tasks such as task automation, building continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and creating serverless functions.

Node.js has a vast and active community, with a rich ecosystem of packages and modules available through the npm (Node Package Manager) registry. It is widely adopted by both startups and large enterprises due to its scalability, performance, and ease of use.

Overall, Node.js is a versatile runtime that can be used in a wide range of applications and scenarios where a scalable and efficient server-side environment is required.

### 2. Why use Node.js?
Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:

-   It is generally fast
-   It rarely blocks
-   It offers a unified programming language and data type
-   Everything is asynchronous
-   It yields great concurrency

### 3. How does Node.js work?

A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Letâ€™s explore this flow of operations in detail.

-   Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:
-   Querying for data
-   Deleting data
-   Updating the data
-   Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
-   The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources
-   The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients

A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.
