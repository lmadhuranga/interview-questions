Dependency Injection is a core concept in Angular, and it plays a crucial role in how components, services, and other objects are created and managed within the framework. In an interview, you can explain Dependency Injection in Angular as follows:

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to manage the dependencies between different parts of an application. It is a way to provide the objects that a class needs (its dependencies) instead of having the class create them itself. This allows for loose coupling between components and services, making the code more maintainable, testable, and flexible.

In Angular, DI is achieved through the use of a DI container or an Injector. The Injector maintains a registry of services and their dependencies, and when a component or service needs a dependency, the Injector resolves it and provides it to the requesting object.

The benefits of using Dependency Injection in Angular are:

1. Modular and Reusable Code: With DI, each component or service becomes a standalone, self-contained unit that can be easily reused and replaced in different parts of the application.

2. Testability: DI allows for easy mocking and testing of components and services, making it simpler to write unit tests and ensure the reliability of the application.

3. Flexibility: Components and services can be easily swapped or extended with different implementations, allowing for better flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.

To implement DI in Angular, you typically use the `@Injectable()` decorator to mark a class as a service, and then you specify its dependencies in the constructor using parameter-based injection. Angular's DI system will take care of providing the correct instances of the dependencies when they are needed.

For example, consider a UserService that needs an instance of an HttpService to make HTTP requests. You would define the UserService as:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private http: HttpService) {
    // The HttpService instance will be automatically provided by the DI system
  }
}
```

In summary, Dependency Injection in Angular is a powerful pattern that promotes code modularity, testability, and maintainability by providing a way to manage and inject dependencies into classes and services. It is one of the key features that make Angular a robust and developer-friendly framework.

Sure, let's illustrate Angular's dependency injection system with an example. Suppose we are building a simple Angular application that allows users to display and manage a list of tasks. We'll create a service to manage the tasks, and two components: one to display the list of tasks, and another to add new tasks.

1. Task Service:
We'll start by creating a service that manages the tasks. The service will have methods to get the list of tasks and add new tasks.

```typescript
// task.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class TaskService {
  private tasks: string[] = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3'];

  getTasks(): string[] {
    return this.tasks;
  }

  addTask(newTask: string): void {
    this.tasks.push(newTask);
  }
}
```

2. Task List Component:
Next, we'll create a component to display the list of tasks. This component will depend on the `TaskService` to fetch the list of tasks.

```typescript
// task-list.component.ts

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { TaskService } from './task.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-list',
  template: `
    <h2>Task List</h2>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">{{ task }}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class TaskListComponent implements OnInit {
  tasks: string[] = [];

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.tasks = this.taskService.getTasks();
  }
}
```

3. Task Add Component:
Now, we'll create another component to add new tasks to the list. This component will also depend on the `TaskService` to add new tasks.

```typescript
// task-add.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { TaskService } from './task.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-add',
  template: `
    <h2>Add New Task</h2>
    <input [(ngModel)]="newTask" placeholder="Enter task name" />
    <button (click)="addTask()">Add Task</button>
  `,
})
export class TaskAddComponent {
  newTask: string = '';

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

  addTask(): void {
    if (this.newTask.trim()) {
      this.taskService.addTask(this.newTask.trim());
      this.newTask = '';
    }
  }
}
```

4. App Module:
In the main `AppModule`, we need to configure Angular's dependency injection system to provide the `TaskService` as a singleton throughout the application.

```typescript
// app.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { TaskListComponent } from './task-list.component';
import { TaskAddComponent } from './task-add.component';
import { TaskService } from './task.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, TaskListComponent, TaskAddComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule],
  providers: [TaskService], // Configure the TaskService as a provider
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, when the application runs, the `TaskListComponent` and `TaskAddComponent` will have access to the same instance of the `TaskService`. This means they can share data and functionality, allowing the `TaskListComponent` to display the updated list of tasks when a new task is added using the `TaskAddComponent`.

Angular's dependency injection system manages the creation and sharing of the `TaskService` instance, ensuring that all components that depend on it receive the same instance throughout the application's lifecycle. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and modular design in Angular applications.
