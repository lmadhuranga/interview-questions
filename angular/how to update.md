To upgrade your Angular project to a newer version, follow these steps:

1. **Update Angular CLI**: First, ensure that you have the latest version of the Angular CLI installed globally on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
   ```

2. **Check Angular Update Guide**: Visit the official Angular Update Guide (https://update.angular.io/) to get specific instructions for updating your current version of Angular to the desired version. The guide provides step-by-step instructions and highlights any breaking changes or additional actions required during the update.

3. **Update Package.json**: In your project's root directory, open the `package.json` file. Update the version number of the `@angular/core` package to the desired version. Make sure to replace `x.x.x` with the version you want to upgrade to.

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@angular/core": "^x.x.x",
     // other dependencies
   }
   ```

4. **Update Angular Dependencies**: Run the following command in your project's root directory to update all the Angular dependencies specified in the `package.json` file:

   ```
   npm update
   ```

5. **Update Angular Config Files**: Check for any changes or additions to configuration files like `angular.json` and `tsconfig.json` in the new Angular version. Make the necessary updates based on the latest version's recommendations.

6. **Run Angular Update Command**: Starting from Angular 6, the Angular CLI provides an update command to automatically update the application. Run the following command to invoke the Angular Update Tool:

   ```
   ng update
   ```

   The Angular Update Tool will analyze your project and suggest updates to various dependencies, configuration files, and code.

7. **Resolve Update Conflicts**: The Angular Update Tool may encounter conflicts if you have made custom changes to your project. Review the update suggestions and resolve any conflicts manually.

8. **Test the Application**: After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected and that all features are functioning correctly.

9. **Backup**: Before proceeding with the update, it's always a good practice to back up your project and codebase.

10. **Update Project Documentation**: Update your project's documentation to reflect the changes made during the update process.

Always ensure that you follow the official update guide and test your application thoroughly after the update. Additionally, consider creating a version control commit before starting the upgrade process to allow you to revert changes if needed. Upgrading Angular requires careful attention to any breaking changes and possible adjustments in your codebase, so proceed with caution and follow the recommended best practices.
