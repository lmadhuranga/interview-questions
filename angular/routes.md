In Angular, routes are used to navigate between different components and views of a web application. The Angular Router is responsible for managing these routes. It allows you to define URL patterns and associate them with specific components, enabling navigation to different parts of your application based on the URL.

To set up routing in an Angular application, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   In your `app.module.ts` file, import the `RouterModule` and `Routes` from `@angular/router`.

   ```typescript
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
   ```

2. Define your routes:
   Create an array of route configurations using the `Routes` type. Each route configuration maps a URL path to a specific component.

   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }, // Default route
     { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
     { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
     { path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent },
     // Add more routes as needed
   ];
   ```

3. Add the RouterModule to your app module:
   In the `@NgModule` decorator of your `app.module.ts`, import the routes array using the `forRoot` method of `RouterModule`. This method initializes the router with the configured routes.

   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

4. Set up the router outlet:
   In your `app.component.html` (or the root component's template), add a `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` element. This is where Angular will render the component associated with the current route.

   ```html
   <!-- app.component.html -->
   <router-outlet></router-outlet>
   ```

With these steps, your Angular application is now set up with routing. When a user navigates to a specific URL, Angular will load the associated component and display it inside the `<router-outlet>`. You can use Angular's `routerLink` directive to create links and navigate to different routes within your templates.

For example, to navigate to the `about` route:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<a routerLink="/about">About</a>
```

And to navigate to the `contact` route with additional query parameters:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<a [routerLink]="['/contact']" [queryParams]="{ id: 123 }">Contact</a>
```

Angular's routing system allows you to build complex and dynamic single-page applications with multiple views and navigation capabilities.
