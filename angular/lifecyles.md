In Angular, the order of method execution with `ngOnInit` follows a specific sequence in the component's lifecycle. When a component is created, Angular goes through a series of lifecycle hooks in the following order:

1. **constructor:** The constructor of the component is called first. It is used to initialize the component and its properties. However, at this point, Angular has not set the component's input properties, and it's not recommended to perform heavy initialization or access DOM elements.

2. **ngOnChanges (if input properties change):** If the component has input properties (`@Input`), Angular checks if any of these properties have changed. If there are changes, the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook is called. This hook allows you to react to changes in input properties.

3. **ngOnInit:** After the constructor and `ngOnChanges`, the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is called. This hook is commonly used for initialization logic that depends on the input properties and other setup tasks. At this point, the component's input properties are available and initialized.

4. **ngDoCheck:** The `ngDoCheck` hook is called next. It is used to implement custom change detection logic. This hook is called whenever Angular performs change detection, which can be quite frequent.

5. **ngAfterContentInit:** This hook is called after Angular has initialized any content projected into the component using `<ng-content>`. It is commonly used for initialization tasks related to content projection.

6. **ngAfterContentChecked:** The `ngAfterContentChecked` hook is called after Angular has checked and updated the content projected into the component.

7. **ngAfterViewInit:** After the component's view and child views have been initialized, Angular calls the `ngAfterViewInit` hook. This hook is commonly used for tasks that need access to the DOM, such as initializing third-party libraries.

8. **ngAfterViewChecked:** The `ngAfterViewChecked` hook is called after Angular has checked and updated the component's view and child views.

9. **ngOnDestroy:** Finally, when the component is about to be destroyed (e.g., when it is removed from the DOM or its parent is destroyed), the `ngOnDestroy` hook is called. This hook is used for cleanup tasks, such as unsubscribing from observables and freeing resources.

Here's a simple illustration of the method execution order with `ngOnInit`:

```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>{{ message }}</p>',
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() message: string;

  constructor() {
    console.log('Constructor is called.');
    // At this point, the input property (message) is not yet set.
  }

  ngOnChanges() {
    console.log('ngOnChanges is called.');
    // At this point, the input property (message) might have changed.
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('ngOnInit is called.');
    // At this point, the input property (message) is set and available.
  }

  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log('ngDoCheck is called.');
  }

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterContentInit is called.');
  }

  ngAfterContentChecked() {
    console.log('ngAfterContentChecked is called.');
  }

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterViewInit is called.');
  }

  ngAfterViewChecked() {
    console.log('ngAfterViewChecked is called.');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('ngOnDestroy is called.');
  }
}
```

When this component is used in a parent component's template with a different `message` value, the lifecycle hooks are called in the specified order during the component's lifecycle. Keep in mind that certain hooks may be called multiple times during the component's lifecycle, depending on how often change detection is triggered.

Let's assume the `ExampleComponent` is used in the parent component's template with a different `message` value. The output in the console will be as follows:

```
Constructor is called.
ngOnChanges is called.
ngOnInit is called.
ngDoCheck is called.
ngAfterContentInit is called.
ngAfterContentChecked is called.
ngAfterViewInit is called.
ngAfterViewChecked is called.
```

Explanation of the output:

1. `Constructor is called.`: The constructor is called first when the `ExampleComponent` is instantiated. At this point, the `message` input property is not yet set.

2. `ngOnChanges is called.`: The `ngOnChanges` hook is called after the constructor. If the `message` input property has changed (which is likely the case when used in a parent component's template), this hook will be called. It allows the component to react to changes in input properties.

3. `ngOnInit is called.`: After the constructor and `ngOnChanges`, the `ngOnInit` hook is called. This hook is used for initialization logic and setup tasks that depend on the input properties. At this point, the `message` input property is set and available.

4. `ngDoCheck is called.`: The `ngDoCheck` hook is called after `ngOnInit`. It is used for custom change detection logic. This hook can be called quite frequently during the component's lifecycle.

5. `ngAfterContentInit is called.`: The `ngAfterContentInit` hook is called after Angular has initialized any content projected into the component using `<ng-content>`. In this example, there is no content projection, so this hook is called immediately after `ngDoCheck`.

6. `ngAfterContentChecked is called.`: The `ngAfterContentChecked` hook is called after Angular has checked and updated the content projected into the component, if any. Since there is no content projection in this example, this hook is called immediately after `ngAfterContentInit`.

7. `ngAfterViewInit is called.`: The `ngAfterViewInit` hook is called after the component's view and child views have been initialized. This hook is used for tasks that need access to the DOM. In this example, there is no specific DOM-related task, so this hook is called after `ngAfterContentChecked`.

8. `ngAfterViewChecked is called.`: The `ngAfterViewChecked` hook is called after Angular has checked and updated the component's view and child views. Since there are no child views in this example, this hook is called immediately after `ngAfterViewInit`.

The exact sequence and the number of times certain hooks are called may vary depending on factors like change detection, the usage of other components or directives, and event triggering. However, this is the general order of hook execution during the component's lifecycle.
