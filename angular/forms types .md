The main differences between the different form types in Angular (template-driven forms and reactive forms) lie in how they are implemented, how the form controls and validation are defined, and how they handle user input and data binding. Let's explore each form type and provide a sample code example for each:

1. Template-driven Forms:

Template-driven forms are easy to set up as most of the form configuration is done directly in the HTML template using Angular directives like `ngModel`, `ngForm`, and `ngSubmit`. They are suitable for simple forms with basic validation requirements.

Example Code for Template-driven Form:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(myForm.value)">
  <label>Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="name" required>

  <label>Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" [(ngModel)]="email" required email>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  name: string;
  email: string;

  onSubmit(formData: any) {
    console.log(formData);
  }
}
```

2. Reactive Forms:

Reactive forms are more powerful and flexible as the form controls and validation are managed programmatically in the component class using the `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormBuilder` classes from `@angular/forms`. Reactive forms are suitable for complex and dynamic forms with custom validation logic.

Example Code for Reactive Form:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form [formGroup]="myForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <label>Name:</label>
  <input type="text" formControlName="name" required>

  <label>Email:</label>
  <input type="email" formControlName="email" required>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  myForm: FormGroup;

  constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required],
      email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]
    });
  }

  onSubmit() {
    if (this.myForm.valid) {
      console.log(this.myForm.value);
    } else {
      console.log('Form is invalid.');
    }
  }
}
```

In the template-driven form example, the form controls and validation rules are defined using the `ngModel` directive directly in the HTML template. In the reactive form example, the form controls and validation are created programmatically in the component class using the `FormControl` and `FormGroup` classes.

Both form types have their strengths, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application. Template-driven forms are ideal for simple forms with minimal validation, while reactive forms provide more control and customization for complex forms with dynamic validation logic.
