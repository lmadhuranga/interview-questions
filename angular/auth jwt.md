As a text-based AI language model, I can't directly display graphics or visual representations. However, I can provide you with a simple graphic representation of how JSON Web Tokens (JWT) work at a high level:

```
 +----------------+            +--------------------------+
 |    User        |            |        Backend           |
 +----------------+            +--------------------------+
        |                                |
        |      1. Request Login          |
        |------------------------------>|
        |                                |
        |      2. Authenticate User      |
        |<------------------------------|
        |                                |
        |      3. Issue JWT             |
        |------------------------------>|
        |                                |
        |       4. Store JWT           |
        |------------------------------>|
        |                                |
        |     5. Include JWT in         |
        |      API Requests            |
        |------------------------------>|
        |                                |
        |  6. Verify JWT on Backend     |
        |------------------------------>|
        |                                |
        |  7. Allow/Deny Access         |
        |<------------------------------|
        |                                |
        |   8. Process API Request      |
        |<------------------------------|
```

1. The user initiates a login request to the backend.

2. The backend authenticates the user (validates credentials, etc.).

3. If the authentication is successful, the backend generates a JWT with a secret key and includes user-specific data (payload) in it.

4. The backend sends the JWT back to the user, who stores it locally, typically in the browser's local storage or session storage.

5. The user includes the JWT in the headers of subsequent API requests to the backend to access protected resources.

6. The backend verifies the authenticity and validity of the JWT by checking its signature and expiration time.

7. Based on the JWT validation, the backend either allows or denies access to the requested resources.

8. If access is granted, the backend processes the API request and sends the response back to the user.

Remember that this is a simplified representation, and there are more technical details and security considerations involved in implementing JWT-based authentication in a real-world application.
